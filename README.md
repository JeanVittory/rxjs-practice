# Wordle Game 
Welcome to the Wordle Game project! This repository contains a fun and educational game called Wordle, designed to help you practice RxJS with TypeScript.

## Getting Started
To start the project, use the following command:

```sh
npm run start
```
This command will launch the development server and allow you to play Wordle in your browser.

## Technologies Used
This project is built using the following technologies:

- RxJS: Version 7.8.1
RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, making it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.

- Webpack: Version 5.88.2
Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. It helps bundle your assets, scripts, and styles into efficient packages.

- Webpack Dev Server: Version 4.15.1
  Webpack Dev Server is a development server that provides live reloading and other useful features for efficient development.

- TypeScript Loader: Version 9.4.4
  TypeScript Loader is used to load TypeScript files and compile them to JavaScript during the build process.

- Webpack CLI: Version 5.1.4
  Webpack CLI provides a set of commands to interact with Webpack from the command line, allowing for easier configuration and build processes.

## About the Application
Wordle is an engaging word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a secret five-letter word within six attempts. The game provides an excellent opportunity to practice RxJS, a powerful library for reactive programming, in combination with TypeScript. It offers an interactive and enjoyable environment to enhance your coding skills while having fun.

Feel free to explore the source code, modify the game, and continue learning and experimenting with RxJS and TypeScript. Happy coding!
